# Amazon Sales Data Visualization

This project focuses on analyzing and visualizing Amazon sales data to uncover insights through various data visualization techniques. The dataset contains 1,426,337 rows with a size of 18,542,381. Using libraries like `matplotlib` and `seaborn`, we performed extensive data analysis and visualizations, providing insights into different aspects of the sales data.

## Project Overview

The project involves the following key steps:
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Initial exploration of the dataset to understand its structure and identify missing values, outliers, and key features.
2. **Pandas Profiling**: Utilized the pandas profiling library to perform automated exploratory data analysis and generate a comprehensive report.
3. **Data Visualization**: Implemented various visualizations to present insights into:
   - **Descriptive Analysis**: Overview of key statistics of the data.
   - **Comparative Analysis**: Comparison of sales data across different categories.
   - **Category-wise Insights**: Insights into the sales performance of different product categories.
   - **Monthly Analysis**: Examination of sales trends over different months.
   - **Top-N Items**: Identifying top-selling items based on various metrics.
   - **Correlation**: Analyzing the relationships between different numerical variables.
